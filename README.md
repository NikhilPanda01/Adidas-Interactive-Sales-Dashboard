# ADIDAS INTERACTIVE SALES DASHBOARD

 - The Adidas Interactive Sales Dashboard is a dynamic data visualization tool built using Excel's powerful charting features, Which updates automatically based on our preferences.

 - It provides valuable insights into the sales performance of Adidas products in the United States. 
 - This project aims to empower Adidas stakeholders, such as sales managers and executives, with a comprehensive overview of sales data to make informed decisions and optimize business strategies.

 


## Data :-
- I found this dataset on Kaggle. This dataset is a collection of data that covers the sales of Adidas products like number of units sold, the total sales revenue, the location of the sales, the type of product sold, and any other relevant information.
- It contains 9653 rows and 13 Columns in total.
## Approach :
- Analyze Data: Thoroughly analyzing the sales data to identify key metrics, trends, and patterns & Perform data cleaning and transformation as necessary to ensure accurate and reliable visualizations.
- After analysis & data cleaning I created 4 different sheets i.e
1.Sales_trend : Actual sales by time period.
2.Sales_Regions : Trends between sales by Regions.
3.Retailers :Trends between sales & Retailers we are using now.
4.Sales_Method:To find out which Sales method best works out for us(Like Instore or Online method)
  
- Visualization: In this phase I choose Line_chart, Map_chart , Bar_chart, Doughnut_chart for tables Sales_trend, Sales_Regions , Retailers , Sales_Method respectively.

- Making it Dynamic: Implementing dynamic functionality to the dashboard enables users to interact with the visualizations and explore the data further. For this I use 3 diffrent Slicers i.e
Years, Region, Product.
